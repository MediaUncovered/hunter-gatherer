''He likes to see himself, not as an author, but as a publicly subsidized payload of sensitive instruments that records information irrespective of personal values.'' Certainly that was how he appeared to a shocked and intrigued literary world in the 1960's, in books that attacked the very idea of books, as if he were a blameless guru through whom the spirit of the electromagnetic spectrum - the spirit of ''haptic harmony'' and ''tribal wholeness'' and ''synesthesia'' - spoke in puns and gnomic riddles.","headline":{"main":"An Appreciation","kicker":"HE WAS PROPHET OF GROOVINESS WHO GALVANIZED A GENERATION"},"type_of_material":"News","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":{"display_name":"World"},"subsection_name":{},"pub_date":"1981-01-01T00:00:00Z","created":null,"updated":"2009-02-19T08:07:28Z","source":"The New York Times","print_section":"1","print_page":"17","nytddes":["Writing and Writers","Books and Literature"],"web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/01/world/he-was-prophet-of-grooviness-who-galvanized-a-generation-an-appreciation.html","taxonomy_nodes":null,"keywords":[{"isMajor":null,"rank":0,"name":"subject","value":"WRITING AND WRITERS"},{"isMajor":null,"rank":0,"name":"subject","value":"COMMUNICATIONS"}],"byline":"By JOHN LEONARD","pay":"Y","multimedia":[],"document_type":"article","asset_id":null,"_id":"4fd10bba8eb7c8105d5bf84d","timesmachine_url":"http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1981/01/01/207357.html","first_published_iso_timestamp":null,"summary":null,"kicker":null,"tone":null,"promotional_media":null,"authors":null,"advertiser":null,"image_url":null,"paidpost":null,"last_major_modification_timestamp":null,"uri":null},{"snippet":"Governor Carey yesterday commuted the minimum sentences of 16 state prisoners, including Dollree Mapp, whose 1961 conviction in Ohio on obscenity charges had been overturned by the United States Supreme Court.

The 1.2 percent increase in the index of leading indicators - the sixth consecutive monthly rise - was viewed as confirmation that the economy was continuing to perform more strongly than the analysts expected. Although Government and private economists said that they still expected a weakening early in 1981, the addition of this latest statistic to a variety of similarly encouraging figures released in recent days made them less certain of their forecasts.
