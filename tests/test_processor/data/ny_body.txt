Before his New Year's Eve recital at Carnegie Hall, Itzhak Perlman held a sort of preview yesterday afternoon to salute the start of the United Nations International Year of the Disabled. The violinist is a member of the United States committee. He invited 100 guests from the Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine (the Rusk Institute) to hear him rehearse most of the program with his accompanist, Samuel Sanders, himself a busy survivor of three heart operations. Mr. Perlman, who had a major role in obtaining a hydraulic lift for the hall's Seventh Avenue entrance, said his message ''to you, and for the year, is that the disabled face two basic barriers - attitudinal but also architectural, even though the largest minority in the United States is those who are not perfect.'' To end the party, everybody sang ''Auld Lang Syne'' to accompaniment by Mr. Perlman and Mr. Sanders. Laurie Johnston
